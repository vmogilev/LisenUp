<p class="lead">If you are the kind of person who knows what they want and willing to improve things by telling whomever is responsible - "<mark>Don't you get it?</mark>"  Then you've come to the right place!</p> 

<p class="lead">Imagine the day when you can instantly reach those people and companies that are doing these irritating things and influence them with your feedback?  That would make a world of difference!</p>

<p class="lead">The problem is that these people don't even know they are doing something wrong, so they are not looking for your feedback.  To make them notice we need a movement so contagious that they will have no other choice but to join in.  So we started <strong>LisenUp</strong> to become that movement.</p>

<p class="lead">We believe that if enough of us show by example, that candid feedback matters, then it will become a norm.  A norm is something everyone will want to participate in, including those who today think they don't need it.  And these are the people that you want to improve.</p>

<!-- <p class="lead">If you believe in our mission - then join us, and start to <strong>LisenUp</strong> and make it contagious!</p> -->
